# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Systems Projects

## Project 1 - Problem Solving and Search Methods 

This project aimed to improve the use of the **Prolog** logic programming language, within the representation of imperfect knowledge, resorting to the use of _null values_ and the creation of adequate reasoning mechanisms. Through programming in logic, it was possible to create a knowledge base related to a public procurement area for the execution of contracts for the provision of services.

## Project 2 - Programming in Extended Logic and Imperfect Knowledge 

This project aimed to improve the use of the **Prolog** logic programming language, in the context of problem solving methods and in the development of _research algorithms_, using different research strategies (**uninformed** and **informed**). ([Technical report](https://github.com/JoaoDiogoMota/SRCR/blob/master/Trabalho_Individual/report.pdf))
